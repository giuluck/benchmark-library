  Let us assume that we are at the early stages of an epidemic.
  We want to do our best to control while we wait for a cure/vaccine.
  Hence, we need to decide which actions to take in order to minimize the total number of infected.
  But we are subjected to a variety of constraints (e.g. socio-economical impact).

  For our epidemics we will rely on a SIR model, which is the simplest type of compartmental model.
  The population is divided into three groups (compartments), i.e. Susceptibles (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).
  The classical SIR model is dynamic, indeed the size of the three groups evolves over time.
  The evolution of the model is defined by the following system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):
      dS = -𝛽 * S * I / N
      dI = 𝛽 * S * I / N - 𝛾 * I
      dR = 𝛾 * I
  with N being the total population size, and 𝛽 and 𝛾 the infection and recovery rate, respectively.
